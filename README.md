Computer Science Laboratory (Project) (Group: Ular Trio)
In this project, we have worked on existing source code to improve the model. The code can predict the skin cancer melanoma and distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions nevius and seborrheic keratoses. 

The data used for this project are saved in the train, test, and valid folders. The report for our project can be obtained from the Project_Report_CSL.pdf
